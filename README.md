# secure-iot-data-streamer
This project is a personal showcase system that simulates IoT sensor data, streams it securely via MQTT (with TLS), and exposes a REST API (FastAPI) for data accessing and auditing. Deployed on Ubuntu Server.

## Features
- Simulate sensor Data.
- Streams data "securely" via MQTT using TLS.
- REST API for data access
- Modular and scalable as possible using programming concepts.
- Deployment using Ubuntu.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- paho-mqtt
- FastAPI
- Mosuitto MQTT broker (TLS)
- Ubuntu (Deployment)

## Status
In progress - first prototype

## Goals
- Demonstrate secure, scalable IoT data pipeline.
- Apply backend and programming design principles
